Problem statement – Fake news classification

Goal - Develop a supervised learning model that can accurately classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Motivation - Fake news can have a significant negative impact on society, as it can mislead people, spread misinformation, and cause harm to individuals and organizations. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable, efficient systems to detect and combat the spread of fake news.

Business value and impact – Fake news classifier model can be integrated into systems and platforms such as news aggregators to provide users with reliable information and reduce the spread of misinformation.

Dataset – fake_or_real_news.csv


Steps of the supervised learning:

- Data Collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Determining features and label
- Split data into training and test sets
- Feature engineering - extract features from the text to help predict the label
- Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm that can handle NLP data, Naive Bayes to start with
- Model Training
- Evaluate the trained model using the test set
- Compare it with other models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines and see which model performs better
